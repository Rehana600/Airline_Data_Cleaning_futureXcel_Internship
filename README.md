# Airline Passenger Satisfaction – Data Cleaning Project

This project is part of my Data Science Internship. In this assignment, I worked on a real-world airline passenger satisfaction dataset and performed complete data cleaning and preprocessing using Python.

The main purpose of this project was to understand how real datasets contain missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers, and how these issues can be handled professionally.

## Dataset Information
- Dataset: Airline Passenger Satisfaction
- Source: Kaggle
- Records: 100,000+
- Type: Real-world survey dataset

The dataset includes passenger details such as age, gender, travel type, flight distance, delays, and satisfaction level. Some columns contained missing values and inconsistent formats.

## Work Done in This Project
In this project, I performed the following steps:

- Loaded the dataset in Google Colab
- Checked dataset structure and size
- Analyzed missing values using tables and heatmap
- Handled missing values using mean, mode, and KNN imputation
- Corrected incorrect data types
- Detected and removed outliers using the IQR method
- Verified the final cleaned dataset
- Saved the cleaned dataset as a CSV file

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## What I Learned
This project helped me gain practical experience in handling messy real-world data. I learned how to clean data step by step and prepare it for further analysis and machine learning tasks.
